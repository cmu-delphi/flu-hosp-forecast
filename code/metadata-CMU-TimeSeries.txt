team_model_designation: primary
methods: A basic quantile autoregression fit using influenza-related
  hospitalizations and doctors visits.
ensemble_of_hub_models: false
team_funding: CDC Center of Excellence, gifts from Google and Facebook
data_inputs: US Dept. of Health and Human Services (confirmed influenza
  hospitalization admissions, normalized by population), Change Healthcare
  (estimated percentage of outpatient doctors visits with confirmed influenza)
methods_long: "A basic quantile autoregression fit using lagged values of\
  \ influenza-related hospitalization counts, normalized by population, and\
  \ percentage of doctors visits related to influenza.  The data are smoothed\
  \ in time, and the latter data source is adjusted to remove systematic\
  \ day-of-week effects.  The model is fit jointly across all 50 US states,\
  \ the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  Each\
  \ of the 23 quantiles is learned using a separate quantile regression, with\
  \ nonnegativity and sorting constraints applied post hoc.  All signals are\
  \ available as indicators as indicators through Delphi Epidata\
  \ (https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/)."
